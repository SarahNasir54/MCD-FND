# MDC-FND
This is the Official implementation of "MDC-FND: A Multimodal and Context-Driven Approach to Fake News Detection"
We present MCD-FND (Multimodal Context-Driven Fake News Detection), a multimodal fake news detection model that effectively detects false news by combining social context and contextualizing multimodal characteristics. Textual and social context characteristics are extracted using BERT, while visual features are extracted using VGG-19.
